        <p class="m-0 font-[OldNewspaperTypes] mt-3 text-justify break-words">
          My open-source journey began with a <em>tiny bug</em> in a <strong>GNOME extension</strong> that was driving me mad. Instead of waiting for a miracle, I thought, <em>“Why not try fixing it myself?”</em> It was messy, chaotic, and honestly a little scary, but after hours of trial and error, I did it. <strong>The bug was squashed, and I was hooked.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="m-0 font-[OldNewspaperTypes] mt-3 text-justify break-words">
          That one small fix opened the door to something bigger—<strong>Open Voice OS</strong>. Here, I found a community that wasn’t just about coding; it was about <em>learning</em>, <em>sharing</em>, and cheering each other on. Every tiny contribution I made felt like a victory, and the encouragement I got was like fuel to keep going.
        </p>
        <p class="m-0 font-[OldNewspaperTypes] mt-3 text-justify break-words">
          Now, open source is a part of who I am. It’s messy, it’s unpredictable, and sometimes it makes me want to pull my hair out—but it’s also one of the most <em>rewarding</em> things I’ve ever done. If you’ve ever thought about diving in, I say, <em>do it!</em> Start with something small, embrace the chaos, and find your place in the community. Trust me—it’s worth it.
